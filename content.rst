**Description**

This course is my note on `Rust Tutorial Full Course (video)`_ free course
available on YouTube. It gives a good introduction 
to the Rust programming language. Derek Banas' chanel has always been 
my goto chanel when I need a refresher on a course or simply learn a new 
programming language. This is my transcription and collection of notes based 
on the course. I will try to follow how Derek did it but 
there may be some deviation as I seek better understand, organization of topics etc..

* This course aim at helping one gain familiarity with Rust.

**Organization**

This tutorial series present various examples as we explore the feature and 
syntax of Rust. Each section contain fully self-contained 
examples ready to be compiled.

* The documentation and code are all included. I use my python sphinx template 
  to render the documentation.
