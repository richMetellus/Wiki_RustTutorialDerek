fn main() {

    // is it still a string literal when it is mutable?
    let mut s: &'static str  = "hello"; // type is `&'static str`
    println!("s = {s}");
    println!("address of s {:p}", &s);
    // does the compiler coerce the type be &str or String?
    s = "Salut le monde!"; // is this heap-allocated or not? there is no `let` so not shadowing
    println!("s after updating its value: {s}"); // Compiler will not complain

    // Why does the code above work? since a string literal is a reference. 
    // A string literal is a string slice that is statically allocated, meaning 
    // that itâ€™s saved inside our compiled program, and exists for the entire 
   // duration it runs. (MIT Rust book)
