Hashmaps 
#########

Hashmaps 

* are going to be used to store key-value pairs.
* To use them you need to use the standard library
  ``uses std::collections::HashMap``

Let's create an example program that demonstrate HashMaps.

1. Create a new project. 
   
   .. code-block:: console 

      cd _resources/Examples 
      cargo new tut-009_hashmaps

2. Let's create a hashmap that will user for key the superhero codename and  for
   value the super hero real name.
   
   .. literalinclude:: ./_resources/Examples/tut-009_hashmaps/src/main.rs
      :language: Rust 
      :linenos:

   * often we need to be very safe about we are doing with Rust. Let's say we want 
     to search for a specific key in a hashmap before we try to print out 
     anything. In line 23-30, we verify that a key "Batman" exist in our heroes store. 
     If there is a match, we print that "batman is a hero".

#. Run the code 
   
   .. code-block:: console 

      cd tut-009_hashmaps
      cargo run
   
   .. code-block:: console 
      :caption: example of output 

      Superman = Clark Kent
      Batman = Bruce Wayne
      The Flash = Barry Allen
      Length : 3
      Batman is a hero

#. Commit the changes and tag it RS-009.0_v0.0.1
