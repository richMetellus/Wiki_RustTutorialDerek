Ownership in Rust 
###################

In Rust, memory is going to be managed through a system of ownership with rules 
that are checked at compile time.

To understand this, you must understand the difference between 2 parts of memory 
which would be Stack and Heap.

**Stack**

* **Stack**: stores values in a last in first out (LIFO) format.
  
  * Data on the stack must have a defined fixed size.

* (tbr.) Stack is just a region of a program memory.
  
  * (tbr.) In environment with a Memory Management Unit (MMU), a non-microcontroller environment,
    like Linux, an Operating system will assign a program with memory address 
    space known as **virtual memory** 

    * Virtual memory consist of providing an address space as large as the 
      capacity of the external memory (disks) (Goodrich, Memory Management PPT, 2014)
    
    * (tbr) a chunk of that virtual memory will the stack. 
      
      * that chunk of virtual memory will be mapped to physical address in RAM, 
        thus a program stack is stored in RAM.

* (tbr.) Stack is stored in RAM, regardless of the platform we run the code in. (Microcontroller 
  without MMU (bare metal programming) or Linux Platform with MMU).

* In a multi-threaded application, each thread will have its own stack. 
  But, all the different threads will share the heap (ProgramInterview.com)

* Local variables are put on the stack.
* reference variables are also put on the stack

**Heap**

* (tbr) is a [shared] region of a progam memory set aside for dynamic allocation.
* the chunk of memory is in RAM.
* When putting data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The 
  memory allocator (OS in most case) finds space available and returns an address 
  for that space and that reference to that space in memory is called a pointer. 

* class instances are put on the heap. 
  
  .. note:: Reference variables (object name) and class instances (Object = a block representing 
     a single class instance) are distinct from each other.

.. card:: Ownership Rule 

   1. Each value has a variable that's called its owner
   2. There is only one owner at a time.
   3. When the owner goes out of scope the value disappears.
      
   
   Basically whenever the compiler says we're no longer going to be using this, 
   then it just deleted and that memory is free.

Borrow after Move 
******************

.. note:: while automatic deallocation of resource is great, there are problems 
   that can occur. 

   Imagine if you copied a string (heap allocated). The string just stores 
   a pointer (ptr) to the index and the memory required for each character and then
   the number of characters you would have.

   * What would happen if we would delete one of these strings? well the information 
     would then be deallocated for both strings.
   
   The great thing about rust, the compiler will alert of eventual problem 
   almost always.

Let's verify Rust ownership rule with an example:

1. Create a new project 
   
   .. code-block:: console 

      $ cargo new tut-008_ownership
          Creating binary (application) `tut-008_ownership` package

          // create 2 strings
          let str1: String = String::from("World");
          let str2: String = str1;

          println!("Hello {}", str2);

          //Uncomment this and try to print str1 after assignment (move)
          // println!("Hello {}", str1);

      }

     * *borrow of moved value:* ```str1```

     * This means you took the value that was origanally assigned in line 3, str1, 
       then assigned in line 4 to str2. str1 can no longer be the owner of the 
       value ``"World"``

       * This would have violated rust ownership rule 2. 
         
         "2. There is only one owner at a time."
       
       * The value "World" is owned by str2 now.

       * (tbr) By default, for heap allocated elements rust does not do a deep 
         copy, the data on the heap will not be copied, but rather fo kinda like a shallow 
         copy, except Rust call it a *move* since the original variable ``str1`` 
         is considered invalid by Rust. The pointer str2 (stack element) points to 
         the same heap object that str1 (a stack element) points to. 

       * after line 4 ``let str2 = str1;`` Rust consider ``str1`` as no longer 
         valid but does not free that heap data i.e Rust does not automatically 
         call ``drop`` function on the heap allocated memory for the variable 
         str1 and str2. If Rust would drop both, when ``str1`` and ``str2`` goes 
         out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory location 
         and this would have lead to double free error as that would try to free
         the same heap memory location which could lead to memory corruption.
   
   .. seealso::

      * `What is Ownership in Rust?`_


To solve the *Borrow after move* error, we can call the ``clone()`` method 
on ``str1``.

* This will make a deep copy of str1. So str2 will point to a separate heap 
  object.

   .. admonition:: Q: Does the rule of ownership apply to array in rust?

      After a quick google of that question, you can visit the following links:

      * Rust track of the ownership of arrays in a coarse granularity (per the whole 
        array) because the borrow checker runs at compile time and you "borrow and move 
        the ownership of the array as a whole entity" 
        (`reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/zazfe0/why_coarsegrain_ownership_for_arrays/>`_)
      
      .. seealso::

         * `Ownership differences between tuples and arrays in Rust`_ 
            
            * Tuples are like anonymous structs, and accessing an element in a tuple
              behaves like accessing a **struct field**.

              ...

              While a.0 just accesses a field, a[0] calls a function! Functions 
              can't partially borrow something, so the indexing operator must 
              borrow the entire array.
            
            * the compiler is, unfortunately is not that smart (indexing is generally 
              performed by a runtime calculated value).

         * `Why coarse-grain ownership for arrays | reddit`_ 
         * `Static array ownership and move`_ 
   

Let's create another example to see more what is going on.

#. Commit the change to mark that section

Derrick did not give details or explanation. What is the compiler teaching us? 

* Need to understand Move & Copy in Rust 
* Needs to understand Ownership and Borrowing in Rust. 

   * Borrowing is a way to give temporary access to a value without transferring 
     ownership.

*  Need to understand difference between reference and raw pointer in Rust

   .. card:: Note: 

      There is some difference in rust semantic about references and raw pointer. 
      
      * `What's the difference between references and pointers in Rust?`_

      **References**

      * References have some rules enforced by the compiler. 
        
        1. They cannot outlive what they refer to (the "referent")
        2. mutable references cannot be aliased. 
      
      * References behave a lot like the variables they point to. 
        
        * They have a type 
        * you can interact with that type to read it or (with mutable reference)
          modify it
      
      **Pointers** in Rust.

      * pointers are semantically more about the address. This means that when 
        we interact with them, we'll be modifying the address (things like add 
        will do pointer offsets instead of adding to the underlying value). 
      
        * When we print them, we don't print the underlying value—in fact, we 
          cannot get to the underlying value at all without the ``unsafe`` keyword. 
          Instead, we print out the address.

      We can see this with a simple program.

      .. code-block:: Rust 

         fn main() {
             let x: u32 = 10;
             let ref_x: &u32 = &x;
             let pointer_x: *const u32 = &x;

             println!("x: {x}");
             println!("ref_x: {}", ref_x);
             println!("pointer_x: {:?}", pointer_x);
         }
      
      run this code and we get an output similar to that one

      .. code-block:: console

         x: 10
         ref_x: 10
         pointer_x: 0x7ffff1832524
      
      When we interact with the variable directly or the reference, we get the 
      underlying value. But with the pointer, we get the address!

      You can still access the underlying values with pointers, but you have to use 
      ``unsafe`` to do so. To see why, we can just try to dereference a raw pointer 
      without unsafe and get an error message:

      .. code-block:: console 

         Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
         error[E0133]: dereference of raw pointer is unsafe and requires unsafe block

           |
           = note: raw pointers may be null, dangling or unaligned; they can violate aliasing rules and cause data races: all of these are undefined behavior

      .. important:: So that's the difference between references and pointers in Rust: 
         Using references is safe. 
         
         * The compiler will check that you don't alias 
           the same mutable variable multiple times, ensuring you don't have data 
           races. 
         * It will ensure that any references do not outlive the memory they refer to.

         With raw pointer 

         * You have to verify all those things yourself with raw pointers, so it's unsafe.
         
         The difference between reference in pointer in Rust:
         
         **they have the same underlying data, but different constraints and 
         semantics with the compiler.**
