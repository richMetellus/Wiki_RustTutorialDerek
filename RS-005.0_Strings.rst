Strings 
########

There are 3 types of strings: 

1. string literals:
   
   .. code-block:: Rust 

      let s = "hello";
   
   * ``s`` is a string literal, where the value of the string is hardcoded directly 
     into the final executable, more specifically into the ``.text`` section of 
     our program.

   * string literal is immutable. 
     
     * notice there is no need for the  ``mut`` keyword during the definition 
       of the string literal variable.
     
     .. code-block:: Rust 

        fn main() {
            let mut s = "Hello";
            let s1 = s;
            println!("s = {s}, s1= {s1}");
        }
     
     * this code will compile with warnings, and it will run 
     
     .. code-block:: console 
        :caption: example of output from Rust playground

#. ``String`` - which is a vector of bytes that can be changed. 
    
    * You can create a ``String`` from a *string literal* using the ``from`` 
      function, like so::

         let s = String::from("hello");

2. ``&str`` - reference and string type, which point to a string and 
   allow for viewing of said string.

   * (tbr.) This is known as the "string slice" type in rust.
