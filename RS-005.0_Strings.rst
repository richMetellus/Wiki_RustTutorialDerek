Strings 
########

There are 2 types of strings: 

#. ``String`` - which is a vector of bytes that can be changed. 
    
   * You can create a ``String`` from a *string literal* using the ``from`` 
     function, like so::

        let s = String::from("hello");
   
   * (tbr.) since variables of type ``String`` can contain growable UTF-8 
     encoded value, the size of a string might not be known at compile time, 
     thus strings are normally allocated to the heap. 


#. ``&str`` - reference and string type, which point to a string and 
   allow for viewing of said string.

   * (tbr.) This is known as the "string slice" type in rust.

.. note:: The instructor did not go into much details then jump to coding. 
   I added some additional notes and resources as well. I think understand the 
   concept of Ownership and Borrowing should be researched as well to understand
   how rust is different and handle strings differently.

   .. seealso:: Some good reading. Derek did not go into details of how Rust 
      string is different than C string.

``String`` Type 
****************



``String`` [1]_

* is a re-sizable data structure. 
  
  * unlike a string literal, the size is not known at compile time. 

* is s a sequence of Unicode scalar values encoded as a stream of 
  UTF-8 bytes [1]_

  * UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit) is a type of encoding standardized 
    by the International organization for Standardization (ISO) in 
    `ISO 10646 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set>`_
  
  * UTF-8 is a "variable width" encoding standard.
    
    * i.e it can encode the data (`code points`_ (character, emoji, etc)) using 
      a different number of bytes.

      * `code points` are the atomic unit of storage of information in an encoding
        scheme.
               
        * in UTF-8, code points are sequence of 1 to four bytes long that has been 
          assigned a meaning in a table.
        * (tbr) they are a more abstract term instead of using character since a code point 
          can be used to encode more than just letters & numbers.

    * As a space-saving measure, commonly used code points are represented with 
      fewer bytes than infrequently appearing code points.
     
    * some encoding can use 1 byte, 2 bytes, 3 bytes or 4 bytes. 

  * UTF-8 can represent up to :math:`2^{21} = 2,097,152` code points, more than 
    enough to cover the current :math:`1,112,064` unicode code points.


* unlike some systems languages like C/C++, in Rust strings are not NUL-terminated and 
  can contain NUL bytes (ASCII code 0, Unicode U+0000) [1]_

**String type**

* The ``String`` type in Rust is a growable, heap-allocated, 
   UTF-8 encoded string.

* *Use when*:
   
  * when you need a mutable and dynamic string that can be modified and 
    resized at runtime.

* *creation* : You can create a new ``String`` by calling its associated 
   function ``String::new()`` or by converting from a string slice using the 
   ``to_string()`` method.

String Slice type ``&str``
***************************

**string slice** type 

.. note:: there is no built-in data type name ``str`` but rather ``&str``,
   to indicate a string slice. 

2. ``&str`` - reference and string type, which point to a string and 
   allow for viewing of said string.

   * (tbr.) This is known as the "string slice" type in rust.
   
   * Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection 
     rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does 
     **not have ownership**. (Rust Book, ch 4.3)
   
   * A string slice is a reference to part of a ``String``, and it looks like this:

   .. code-block:: Rust 

      let s = String::from("hello world"); // String type

      let hello = &s[0..5]; // string slice
      let world = &s[6..11]; // another string slice

   
   |
   
   I. **string literals**: a type of string slice stored in the binary

      .. code-block:: Rust 

         let s = "hello";

      * ``s`` is a string literal, where the value of the string is hardcoded directly 
        into the final executable, more specifically into the ``.text`` section of 
        our program. (Rust book)

      * string literal is a type of string slice and be viewed 
        as type annotated as ``&'static str`` 

        * i.e string literal type is ``&'static str`` (MIT Rust book)
      
      * A string literal is a string slice that is statically allocated, meaning 
        that it’s saved inside our compiled program, and exists for the entire 
        duration it runs. (MIT Rust book)

        .. code-block:: rust 
           
           #![allow(unused_variables)]
           fn main() {
           let greeting = "Hello there."; // greeting: &'static str
           }
                   
        * The ``greeting`` binding is a reference to this statically allocated 
          string. 
      
      * Any function expecting a string slice will also accept a string 
        literal.
      
      * ``s``, string literal is immutable but it can be mutable.

        * notice there is no need for the  ``mut`` keyword during the definition 
          of the string literal variable.

        .. code-block:: Rust 

           fn main() {
               let mut s = "Hello";
               let s1 = s;
               println!("s = {s}, s1= {s1}");
           }

        * this code will compile with warnings, and it will run
