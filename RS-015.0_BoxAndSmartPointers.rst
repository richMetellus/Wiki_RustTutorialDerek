Smart Pointers and Box 
########################

**Objectives**

* Explore the Box smart pointers, the reference pointer

Basically a pointer is just an address to a location in memory. We've been using 
them during the tutorial whenever we use the reference operator ``&`` to borrow 
a value rather than taking it and having it cleaned out of memory.

We've been using other smart pointers. Strings and vectors are also smart pointers.
Why is that? they own the data and they also have functions for manipulating that 
data. Basically smart pointers just provide functionality beyond referencing a 
specific location in memory and they can also be used to track the ownership of 
data.

Box 
****

To talk about box, we're going to create a binary tree data structure utilizing 
box. 

A box smart pointer basically just store data on the heap instead of the stack.
Box is normally is going to be used when you have a large amount of data that 
is stored on the Heap and then you pass pointer to it on the stack.

if you want to create a box using ``let variable-name: Box<data-type>  = Box::new(data-value)``;

1. Create a project for this new tutorial ``cargo new tut-015_smart-pointers``
#. Add the following code in src/main.rs
   
   .. code-block:: Rust 

      fn main() {
          // ----- SMART POINTERS -----
          // A pointer is an address to a location in memory. We have been
          // using them when we used the reference operator(&) to borrow
          // a value.

          // Strings and vectors are smart pointers. They own
          // data and also have functions for manipulating that data.

          // Smart pointers provide functionality beyond referencing locations
          // in memory. They can be used to track who has ownership of data.
          // Ownership is very important with Rust.

          // ----- BOX -----

          // The Box smart pointer stores data on the heap instead of the stack.
          // All values are stored on the stack by default

          // Stack : Stores values in a last in first out format
          // Data on the stack must have a defined fixed size

          // Heap : When putting data on the heap you request a certain
          // amount of space. The OS finds space available and returns
          // an address for that space called a pointer.

          // A Box is normally used when you have a large amount of data stored
          // on the heap and then you pass pointers to it on the stack.

          // Create a Box with value 10
          let b_int1 = Box::new(10);

          // Get the value
          println!("b_int1 = {}", b_int1);

      }

Box Application: Binary Tree in Rust
=======================================

Let create a struct to try to create a binary tree. A binary tree is a type of 
tree data structure in which

1.  **each node have at most 2 children, referred to as left 
    child and right child**. 

    * exactly 2 for **proper** binary trees 

2. The children of a node are an ordered pair. 
   
   * The value of the data in the left child should be smaller
     than or equal to the value stored in the right child.

Recursive definition of a Binary tree: 

* A tree with a single node [is also a binary tree]. 
* A tree whose root has an ordered pair of children, each of which is also a 
  binary tree.

If we defined a tree node, which can have a left child and a child like the following
we will get an error ``recursive type TreeNode has infinite size``

#. Commit and tag the change RS-015.0_v0.0.2

The reason we will get an error multiple type of errors is because if we try to 
create a binary tree:

1. Rust does not like the idea of a tree node inside of a tree node.
2. if we store like a string inside as Key, the string size can't be known at 
   compilation time.
3. Rust does not like null values. If we have a tree and there is no additional 
   siblings, no left node or right node, that is going to trigger other type of error.

These would have cause all kind of memory problems if Rust allowed that type of 
code. To fix that we need to add the nested node inside of boxes.
