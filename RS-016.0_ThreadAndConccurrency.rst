Concurrency and Thread in Rust
###############################

**Objectives**

* Simulate bank transaction while exploring threads in rust. 

**Intro**

"Concurrent programming going to involve executing different blocks of code  
independently. What is commonly talked about is parallel programming and 
it's different in that code executes at the same time and these different 
blocks of code that execute are referred to as threads and basically a thread is 
going to handle the scheduling as well as the execution of these blocks of code."
(src: Derek)


.. note:: In parallel programming, each thread execute at the same time simultaneously, 
   (i.e in parallel), whereas in concurrent programming say in a 1 core CPU the 
   OS scheduler switch on tasks/threads giving the impression they are running 
   at the same time. Concurrent programming focuses on 
   managing multiple tasks that may or may not be executing at the same time, while 
   parallel programming specifically involves the simultaneous execution of multiple 
   tasks on multiple processors (src: me + google search)

   .. seealso:: `Concurrency vs Parallelism (Medium)`_

      * `Concurrency vs Parallelism (Jakob Jenkov)`_

**Common problems with concurrent programming**

1. Thread are accessing data in the wrong order 
2. Threads are blocked from executing because of confusion over requirements 
   to proceed with execution. (deadlocks).

Rust smart compiler will handle all these cases for us. 

.. include:: ../../relevant_urls.rst

1. Create a new project ``cargo new tut-016-concurrency``

We wil demonstrate there is no guaranteed on when a thread will execute and that 
they will complete execution.

* we will create a thread with ``thread::spawn`` standard library function that 
  count to 25. 

* Then the main thread in main will count to 20.
* then we will observe the output of the execution.

2. Add the following code to main

   .. code-block:: Rust
      :linenos:

      use std::thread;
      use std::time::Duration;

      fn main() {
          // ----- CONCURRENCY -----
          // Concurrent programming involves executing different blocks of code
          // independently, while parallel programming is when different
          // code executes at the same instant of time. A thread handles scheduling
          // and execution of these blocks of code.

          // Common problems with parallel programming involve :
          // 1. Thread are accessing data in the wrong order
          // 2. Threads are blocked from executing because of confusion
          // over requirements to proceed with execution

          // Create a thread with spawn which takes a closure.
          // This thread will show how a thread does not necessarily to everything in
          // time.
          thread::spawn(|| {
              for i in 1..25 {
                  // this tread cycle through and share outputting information to the screen
                  println!("Spawned thread : {}", i);
                  // Forces thread to sleep and allow another thread like main thread to execute
                  thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
              }
          });

          // There are no guarantees on when the threads will execute and
          // that they will complete execution
          for count in 1..20 {
              println!("Main thread : {}", count);
              thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
          }

      }

      Spawned thread : 18
      Main thread : 19
      Spawned thread : 19
      Spawned thread : 20


* The spawned thread is supposed to print out 25 times, and the main thread 
  up to 20 but not including 20.

  * As you can see main prints up to 19.
  * however spawned thread count up to 20 instead of up to 24.
    
    * The reason is because there is no guarantee on when a thread will execute 
      and if they will even complete execution on this current form.
    
    * If we want to guarantee they do finish execute, we call ``.join()`` which will
      make sure the thread is going to complete. Then use ``.unwrap()`` which going 
      to handle the result to pass back.

4. Commit and tag the change so the result can be replicated ``git tag RS-016.0_v0.0.1``

To make sure all thread are guaranteed to complete, make the following modification.

5. Add these changes in main.

The reason the compiler won't let this code compile is because you can have 
a situation in which a closure may outlive the current ``main`` function specially because 
it is borrowing ``bank`` which is owned by the current ``main`` function. 

In any situation in which a thread can outlive the main function and the 
main function owned data that the thread may need, this is going to cause all 
sort of problems. One of the fixes for this, is a smart pointer. This smart 
pointer will allow multiple owners and it's going to block access whenever 
these different parts are needed.

* we're looking for a smart pointer that is going to have a reference. We 
  need a reference smart pointer.
