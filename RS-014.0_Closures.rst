Closures
#########

a closure 

* is a function without a name and they are more likely 
  going to be stored in a variable and can be used to pass a function into another 
  function. [1]_ (Derek) 

* Rust’s closures are **anonymous** functions you can save in a variable or pass 
  as arguments to other functions. [2]_ 

* A closure is any function which **closes over** the **environment** in which 
  it was defined. [3]_
  
  * This means that it can access variables not in its parameter list

The basic layout for creating a closure::

   let var_name = |parameter1, parameter2, ..., parameterN| -> return_type {Body}

where each parameter is in the form ``parameter_name: data_type``

Let's create a couple different closures:

* create a close that indicate somebody can vote.

1. Create a new project
2. Type the following code in main. 
   
   .. code-block:: Rust 

      fn main() {
          // ----- CLOSURES -----
          // A closure is a function without a name and they are sometimes
          // stored in a variable (They can be used to pass a function into
          // another function)
          // let var_name = |parameters| -> return_type {BODY}

          // Create a closure that defines if someone can vote
          let can_vote = |age: i32| {
              age >= 18
          };
          println!("Can vote : {}", can_vote(8));
      }

   .. code-block:: console

#. Commit and tag the change ``git tag RS-014.0_v0.0.1``

Closures can access variable outside of its body unlike functions whenever it 
is borrowing.

1. Add the following code to the project main
   
   .. code-block:: diff 
      :caption: src/main.rs

You can pass closures to function. You can define a function inside of main.
Normally you wouldn't do sort of thing, but rust just like python allow you to 
define nested functions. (a function define inside another function body).

We're going to crete a function that will take in for parameters 2 variables and 
a generic closure. What we're going to do is is pass 1 function that is going to 
add, and another function that is going to multiply the 2 variables.

here we label ``func`` as generic because we want to accept multiple different types
``fn use_func<T>(a: i32, b: i32, func: T) -> i32`` then we use ``where T:`` and 
you're going to list the datatype or parameters that your functions going to have.

let's show how this can be done.

1. add the following modification to the project
